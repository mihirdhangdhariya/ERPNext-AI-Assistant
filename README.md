## 1. Project Overview

### 🎯 Primary Objective  
To create a natural language interface that enables business users to execute ERPNext operations through conversational commands—eliminating training requirements and automating routine workflows.

### 🚨 Problem Statement  
ERPNext's powerful features come with complexity.  
- Users require **8–12 hours of training** for basic tasks  
- Simple operations (e.g., sales reports, leave approvals) are **time-consuming**

### 💡 Solution Approach  
- Interprets natural language queries using **Llama-3**  
- Executes ERPNext operations  
- Returns user-friendly responses  
- Maintains **contextual memory across sessions**

## 3. Database Architecture

**Primary DB:** FAISS (Vector-based)  
**Type:** In-memory store with disk persistence  
**Purpose:** Semantic storage of conversational context

Schema:
'''json
{
  "vector_id": "faiss_index",
  "query": "Show unpaid invoices",
  "response": "INV-50001: ₹50,000",
  "department": "Accounts",
  "timestamp": 1717200000,
  "embedding": [0.21, -0.34, ..., 0.78]
}'''

Supporting Storage:
Context snapshots: JSON files

Mock ERP data: Pandas DataFrames

4. Key Functionalities
🔤 4.1 Natural Language Interface
Over 50+ business intents mapped to ERP logic

“Add 50 units of ITEM-30001 to Main warehouse”
→ update_stock(item_id="ITEM-30001", qty=50, warehouse="Main")

👥 4.2 Department-Specific Agents
Agent	Key Operations
SalesAgent	Lead creation, order tracking, sales analytics
AccountsAgent	Invoice mgmt, payment recording, financial statements
HRAgent	Employee onboarding, leave, contracts
InventoryAgent	Stock updates, alerts, inventory reports
ManagementAgent	Business snapshots, KPI dashboards

🧠 4.3 Context-Aware Memory
Recalls history via vector similarity search

Auto-injects context into future queries

“Show sales for Tech Innovations”
→ Remembers: "Tech Innovations = client C-1001"

🔁 4.4 Self-Correction Workflow
python
Copy
Edit
# Failed:
update_stock(item_id="INVALID_ID")
# Auto Recovery:
SelfCorrectionSystem.correct()
→ Retry with valid ID
📊 4.5 Business Analytics Dashboard
Real-time KPIs

Interactive visualizations

CSV export support
